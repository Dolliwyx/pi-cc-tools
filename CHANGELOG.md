# Changelog

## 1.0.54 — 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **Branch connectors** (`├─` `└─` `│`): default **`theme`** mode (was fixed gray). Uses **dim → muted → thinkingText**, same family as thought/gray prose.
- **Pending tool dots** (○): use theme **dim** when theme-adaptive; grouped counts use the same pending color.

### Fixed

- `/cc-tools branch reset` restores theme-following default, not fixed rgb(72).

## 1.0.53 — 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **Light theme edit/write diffs**: auto-select Shiki `github-light` vs `github-dark`; light panel tint base; Shiki contrast normalization for light backgrounds.
- **Light theme tool status chrome**: pending ○ / blink uses softer `borderMuted` instead of heavy `muted`; grouped tool pending counts match.

## 1.0.52

- Theme-adaptive diff and branch tooling updates.
